### Hello there! 👋
~«General Kenobi!»~

I am Edoardo, a MSc student from 🇪🇺🇮🇹, studying CS at [EPFL](https://epfl.ch/en), in 🇨🇭, focusing my studies on Machine Learning and Security.

- 🔭 I'm currently working on [`RobustBench`](https://github.com/RobustBench/robustbench), a standardized benchmark for adversarial robustness. After the incoming exams, instead, I will start a Software Engineering Internship at Bloomberg LP, in London.
- 🕰️ Previously, I did a research internship at [CYD](https://www.ar.admin.ch/en/armasuisse-wissenschaft-und-technologie-w-t/cyber-defence_campus.html), the Swiss Armed Forces Cybersec Research Center, conducting research at the intersection of Privacy, Security and Machine Learning, hosted by [Dr. Mathias Humbert](https://www.mhumbert.com/).
- 💻 I worked with: Python, Scala, PyTorch, TensorFlow, Pandas, sklearn, Spark, C.
- 🤓 I am planning to learn: Julia, JAX, C++.
- 📫 You can find more info about me on my personal website [edoardo.science](http://edoardo.science).
- ⚡ Interesting fact: apart from 🇮🇹 and 🇨🇭, I lived also in 🇨🇳 for an exchange year!
- 😍 I enjoy: sailing ⛵, swimming 🏊‍♂️, listening to (a lot of) [music](https://www.last.fm/user/dedeswim) 🎧, travelling 🗺️, hiking ⛰️. Of course I love thinking 💭 and coding ⌨️.
